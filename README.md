# 365DayDraw

I generated this project with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3. Vintage, to be sure, but a great way to learn Angular and showcase my [365 Day Draw project](https://scottpdawson.com/365daydraw-challenge-completed/). 

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```
