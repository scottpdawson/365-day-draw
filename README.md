# 365DayDraw

I generated this project with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3. Vintage, to be sure, but a great way to learn Angular and showcase my 365 Day Draw project, too. You can access the project directly at http://365daydraw.scottpdawson.com

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
